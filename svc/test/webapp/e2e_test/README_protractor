********************PRE REQUISITES****************************


--------------------1. Install nodejs-------------------------

Install nodeJS at https://nodejs.org/en/, which should give you npm access.

To test that node has installed successfully, in a command window enter the following

        npm

The npm command should run successfully.


------------------2. Install node module dependencies-------

Open a command window at the PAMM seed root folder and enter the following

        npm install

Provided there are no issues with your proxy, this should install all the required dependencies defined in the
package.json file.


NOTE: When installing protractor some errors are displayed, but do not seem to affect the installation.


--------------------3 Update webdriver manager-------------

The following instructions will update the webdriver-manager package.

Open a command window at the PAMM seed root folder and enter the following command.

        npm run webdriver-update

Provided there are no issues with the proxy, the webdriver-manager globably should update successfully.


********************RUNNING PROTRACTOR TESTS*******************

-------------Run Protractor Tests from Sbt Task----------------

To run the Protractor tests open a command window at the PAMM seed root folder and 
enter the following command

        activator svc/endToEndTest

This will perform the following steps to run the protractor tests 

NOTE - The following steps will be run automatically as part of the above command and are 
       provided for information. They do not need to be invoked manually for the Protractor 
       tests to be run.


-----------------Step 1 - Start a Selenium Server instance-------

The webdriver-manager is a helper tool to easily get an instance of a Selenium Server running.

Use it to download the necessary binaries with the following command:

        npm run webdriver-update

Start a Selenium server instance with the following command

        npm run selenium-start

You can see information about the server status by accessing

        http://localhost:4444/wd/hub



-----------------Step 2 - Start an H2 database instance--------

The H2 database is accesssed by the svc project application and the testsetup project application

This is started by running the following command

        javaw -cp %HOMEPATH%\.ivy2\cache\com.h2database\h2\jars\h2-1.4.187.jar org.h2.tools.Server

This will run on port 8082 of the local machine



-----------------Step 3 - Run testsetup application----------

This Play application provides a RESTful API to run SQL scripts to setup data for each of the protractor tests (if required).
To run the testsetup Play application,  open a command window at your project root folder (pamm.seed) and enter the following

        activator testsetup/run 9001

The testsetup application should now be running on port 9001. 


------------------Step 4 - Run svc application--------------

This is the Angular / Play application which is the main application of the seed. To run the svc Play application,  open a command window 
at your project root folder (pamm.seed) and enter the following

        activator svc/run

The svc application should now be running on port 9000. 


----------------Step 5 - Run the protractor test------------

From the PAMM seed root directory run the following command

        npm run e2e_cucumber_test

This will now invoke the tests configured in the cucumberOpts "require" property of the local-conf.js file
